                Applications for the UK must be completed by BIS students by the beginning of December. However, for Medicine, Veterinary Sciences and Dentistry as well as applications to Oxford and Cambridge, students must apply by the beginning of October in Grade 12 if they wish to be considered for a place the following September. For universities in the UK, you are required to indicate your course of study at the time you apply. If you decide to change your course of study after your first year, you will probably have to reapply through UCAS for the new course. Offers of admission in the UK are contingent upon meeting certain conditions. The major factor in UK admissions is how well you have done on your external examinations.
