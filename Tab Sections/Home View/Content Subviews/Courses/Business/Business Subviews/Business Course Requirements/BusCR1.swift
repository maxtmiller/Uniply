                All candidates must take the computer-based Thinking Skills Assessment: Section 1 (TSA S1) as part of their application. Separate registration for this test is required and it is the responsibility of the candidate to ensure that they are registered. We strongly recommend making the arrangements in plenty of time before the deadline. For everything you need to know, including guidance on how to prepare, see the TSA page.
